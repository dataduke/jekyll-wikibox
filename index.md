# Welcome

Wikibox is an applied paradigm on building a well-organized and consistent wiki for yourself and your team. It is very flexible and can also manage tasks (with various systematic approaches), presentations, cheatsheets, code snippets and documents and last but not least boards (e.g. Scrum Board).

## Characteristics

Wikibox is not your conventional wiki. In fact it is a foundation for a knowledge base with lifetime storage capabilities based on simple technologies (like plaintext only) available for every major operating system including iOS and Android.

## Essentials

Information Pieces are placed on cards. A card is the atomic unit of your system.
Wikibox follows the conventions of four basic categories:

Box 
: is a permanent container of cards. It is the place where your items are stored permanently.

Stack
: is a temporary container of cards. It is the place where you can aggregate cards form various places for use cases as "Ideas for Project X".

Area
: is a permanent container that can keep boxes. It is the place where you can pin and collect boxes for long terms.

Board
: is a temporary container that can keep boxes, stacks and individual cards. It is the place where you interact and fluidly organize all items.

## Caution!

At the moment the project development is still in alpha state.
