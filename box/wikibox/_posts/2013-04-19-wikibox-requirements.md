# Background

After years of searching, learning, twisting and hacking software for my personal knowledge I decided to finally design my own, which will perfectly fit all of my needs.
 
As a developer always wanting to support other developers and knowing about the needed continuous effort for keeping up a software system to be used in permanent production this decision doesn't come easy.

I felt often dangled with 

- too inflexible or too limited usage opportunities, 
- waiting for needed features to be developed and finally released, 
- proprietary file formats, consumed system memory and CPU usage, 
- closed systems aiming to build its own ecosystems to lock you inside etc. 
- (see also Alex Paynes fantastic write up against all-in-systems).

So I used to often switch systems (having tested probably 30 wikis itself) and permanently and desperately ended up wasting a lot of time for maintenance and transformation.

One day I found M. Douglas Write up about his information system, called . I liked the ideas since I had a lot of similar once in the last years.

Afterwards I also read Amber Vs comments in Scrivener Forums. Read Seth Brown Conclusion and own system approach, it was settled and I switched. I built my own file-convention-system and
used tools like command-line grep .... or notational velocity to keep up with it.

Since I also rediscovered index cards thanks to Pile Of Index Cards. (Long forgotten, last seen/used in the 5th grad.) I started using this system with physical cards.

I know had 2 very different systems, also counting taskpaper (switch away from all proprietary task management systems quite some while ago) and evernote (the only all-in-box left due to snappy search of scanned documents and screenshots for my paperless office) and taskpaper, even 4 systems.

Having used a lot of information systems and currently using a Michale Douglas information system and PoIC for quite some time now, the requirements for the new system are very high since I didn't want to loose the greatness I already have.

# Requirements

- Open System
- Easy to adapt to and migrate away from.
- Keep advantages of cli and alfred usability of old system based on M. Douglas system.
- in cooperate images and file attachments but not depend on them
- avoid the pain points of enterprise wikis (confluence, sharepoint, docuwiki etc.)

# Foundation

With the arise of systems like jekyll that patchwork a lot of differnt technologies for processing plaintext files of a hugh vareitey of formats with the easyness of styling via css-languages and some basic templateing (Shopify Liquid is still quite small and inflexible compared to Jinja or Rails or Django) the idea to not start from scratch was easily made.

In fact for the moment I stick with jekyll since you can run everything also as public website via github pages very smoothly.
